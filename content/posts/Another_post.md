# Mushrooms hail the coming of the fall.

The trees shed their leaves in preparation for winter. These beautiful structures come out to clean up what remains of the dead wood and leaves, and bring a food source to animals. A perfect time for a little nature walk. Luckily, there's a woods right outside of Stuttgart Campus.
