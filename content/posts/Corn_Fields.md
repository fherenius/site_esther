# The world is getting ready for winter

![Hello There](/images/Fieldday-7.jpg)

At this time of year, the trees are a blazing orange hue. 
![It's like the world's on fire](/images/Fieldday-2.jpg)

You have to be in time to catch it, before it's gone.

What better time than a sunny day to go out and look at all the creatures that are stocking up for the coming winter.

From the flocks of sparrows hiding in the fields of dead sunflowers.

To the imposing ravens carefully scouring the fields.

And a friend out for a walk.

The world is vibrant with life this time of year.
